# Heart Risk Detection System

## Project Overview
The Heart Risk Detection System is a machine learning–based project developed using Python for Data Science. The main objective of this system is to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on various medical and physiological attributes. The project uses the well-known UCI Heart Disease dataset, which is widely used for research and academic purposes.

## Dataset
- **Name:** UCI Heart Disease Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
- **Attributes:** Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG Results, Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina, Oldpeak, Number of Major Vessels, Thal, and Diagnosis.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Methodology
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Data cleaning and handling duplicates  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations  
4. Feature selection and scaling  
5. Model training using HistGradientBoostingClassifier  
6. Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve  

## Results
The trained model achieves good accuracy and effectively classifies patients into high-risk and low-risk categories. Feature importance analysis highlights key medical factors contributing to heart disease risk.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning and data analysis can assist in early detection of heart disease and support preventive healthcare decisions.
